# WEB-DEP
A webpage built from scratch to run HTML, CSS, JS code simultaneously.Inspired from JS Bin website.
The webpage is written using HTML, CSS, Jquery.Except the design all the code is written without any outside refrence.
Iframe is used to run the HTML, CSS content written by the user.
Eval function from JavaScript is used to apply user's JS code to the output_window.

-Console window is disabled as it's application on the Iframe is out of scope currently.
Any ideas on it's implementation are welcome:)
